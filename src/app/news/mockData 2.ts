        Volunteers picked up trash and other debris at five Windsor parks Saturday during a marathon Trash Mob Day in honour of April’s Earth Day.
  
        “(This is) the big one where we do five parks,” said Stepan Tuzlov, a Windsor of Change member and co-organizer of the event.
  
        “That’s like an Earth Day special but other than that we do (Trash Mob Days) once every two weeks, weather permitting.”

        Ahead of the event, Tuzlov said 17 people committed to volunteering Saturday and 80 more said they were interested, so he was expecting a good turnout despite the rainy morning.

        Cleanup started at Gateway Park, a former train cut that runs from Riverside Drive to Wyandotte Street West.

        That was followed by McKee Park on the waterfront in Old Sandwich, Malden Park and Superior Park on the city’s west side, and finishing up at Lanspeary Park, between Giles Boulevard and Ottawa Street.

        Volunteers were provided with gloves and garbage bags and grabber sticks to help pick up debris. Tuzlov said they always find lots of plastic, metal and paper, cans and bottles, and even sometimes needles or construction materials.

        Gateway Park is a regular stop for the cleanups but Tuzlov said he scouts local parks to see which ones could use some TLC.

        Federal, provincial and territorial forest ministers have signed on to a national strategy that they say aims to raise awareness of wildfire risks across the country.

        B.C. Forests Minister Bruce Ralston, chair of the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers, says the wildland fire prevention and mitigation strategy is a “call to action” to raise awareness, strengthen First Nations partnerships and expand investment in fire prevention.

        The plan aims to contribute to a national goal that by next year 60 per cent of Canadians in areas of high fire risk are aware of those dangers, and half of Canadians will have taken concrete actions to better respond to climate change.

        Federal Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson says the targets mean Canadians will be able to hold their governments accountable for progress made over the coming years.

        The strategy says by 2025 all jurisdictions will “establish dedicated prevention and mitigation governance structures” and have targeted wildfire training across industries and communities.

        Mr. Ralston says a working group has been created with provincial, territorial and federal officials to decide how the strategy will be implemented.

        He says further conversations are being planned with First Nations and industry representatives, and that the document will evolve as progress is made.

        “We recognize that the challenges are bigger than one government, agency or community can take on themselves. It requires a whole of society approach,” Mr. Ralston said.

        For the CoR's COP28 delegation and for subnational governments globally, COP28 was not only a significant step forward in global climate efforts with the historic agreement to transition away from fossil fuels, but also represented a breakthrough in a long-standing challenge for subnational governments worldwide: making their voices heard at UN summits.

        COP28 witnessed an unprecedented engagement by the COP28 Presidency, which hosted the first-ever Local Climate Action Summit (LCAS) and the second Ministerial Meeting on Urbanisation and Climate Change on the official COP agenda. Additionally, over 70 nations endorsed the COP28 Coalition for High Ambition Multilevel Partnerships (CHAMP), committing to engage with their subnational governments to update their future climate plans, which are due by COP30 in 2025.

        These developments signal a new era of collaboration among all levels of government, to which the CoR has made and will continue to make substantial contributions.

        The CoR will work towards the effective implementation of the decisions made at COP28, both within the EU and globally, with a view to making multilevel action a reality at COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, from 11 to 22 November 2024 and in future COPs.

        A state judge has put a project to add bike lanes through an industrial section of Long Island City on pause after businesses along the stretch claimed the process to redesign the roads went through illegally.

        The judge said before the project can move forward, it’ll need to go through a city environmental review process — calling into question whether new bike lanes could be completed this year.

        The plan — which in its first phase would add a two-way bike lane on Review Avenue and a protected bike lane on other roads in the area — seeks to fill in gaps in transit and improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists, according to the city Department of Transportation.

        It’s part of the department’s bigger “Green Wave” initiative, which seeks to build 30 miles of protected bike lanes every year and improve street safety in all five boroughs.

        But a complaint filed by Queens business LeNoble Lumber says the project would “severely narrow and restrict vehicular traffic lanes” on Review Avenue and would “ruin over 40 businesses, some of which have been in existence for over 100 years.”

        LeNoble argues in the complaint the new bike lanes will have “catastrophic consequences” for the area’s industrial zone because they would affect businesses with “loading docks, tractor trailers constantly coming in and out of garages onto the street, and forklifts into the road.”

        The Province has launched a new program to support whole-building retrofits for apartments, condominums and co-ops, helping make homes more comfortable and reducing energy bills.

        “From record wildfires to historic droughts, British Columbians are seeing the impacts of climate change on their communities and they’re ready to switch from fossil fuels to clean energy, while making their homes more efficient and saving on energy bills,” said Josie Osborne, Minister of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation. “That’s why we are working with BC Hydro to support apartments, condos and co-ops with the upfront costs of completing whole-building retrofits, from highly efficient heat pumps to better windows and ventilation that will make homes more comfortable.”

        Starting Sept. 17, 2024, the CleanBC Multi-Unit Residential Building Retrofit Program, a joint initiative with BC Hydro, will provide rebates and energy coaching to building owners, strata councils and equity co-op boards to make the switch to more energy-efficient and cleaner technologies in their buildings, such as heat pumps and LED lighting, as well as improved windows and ventilation. The new program will also provide funding for the cost of electrical upgrades required for buildings to switch from fossil fuels to clean electricity.

        Through the program, whole-building retrofits can lead to significant energy savings:

        a typical 65-unit rental building could switch from central gas heating to in-suite heat pumps, saving as much as $16,250 per year for the whole building or $250 per year per suite; and
        an average-size 130-suite condo building could replace electric baseboards with heat pumps, saving $18,000 on an average per year for the whole building or $140 per year per suite.
        With $61 million over three years, the CleanBC Multi-Unit Residential Building Retrofit Program is the result of a $26-million investment by the Province, and $35 million from BC Hydro as part of its Energy Efficiency Plan. This partnership means the program will cover energy-efficiency measures in gas-heated and electrically heated apartments and condos.

        In addition to the new program, this funding also supports the existing CleanBC Social Housing Incentive Program, which provides energy-study funding, project implementation support and rebates for social-housing buildings, such as those owned by not-for-profit organizations. The program is being enhanced with new rebates levels that are more than three-and-a-half times higher than before and cover a maximum of 90% of costs, an increase from 75%.

        Energy efficiency is often the best, most cost-effective way for B.C. to meet future energy demand, while also lowering energy bills for people. BC Hydro’s updated Energy-Efficiency Plan includes more than $700 million over the next three years – a 60% increase from previous BC Hydro energy-efficiency budgets – to help people and businesses to waste less energy and save approximately $80 million every year, starting in 2026. 

        “Making smart choices about how we use clean electricity has been core to our business for over 35 years,” said Chris O’Riley, president and CEO, BC Hydro. “Energy-efficiency programs defer the need for additional capital infrastructure, helping to keep rates affordable and offer additional flexibility to our electricity system. But equally important, programs like this one and the many others we offer provide our customers with the opportunity to save energy and money.”

        The new CleanBC Multi-Unit Residential Building Retrofit Program complements the Clean BC  Better Homes Energy Savings Program, which was launched in June 2024, and provides income-tested rebates for individual homes undertaking energy-efficiency and fuel-switching upgrades. The program has received more than 5,200 applications with growing participation throughout the province, and the majority of funding going toward heat pumps and households with lower incomes.

        The Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy released a statement, promising that BC residents will soon benefit from cleaner coastlines.
        
        The Province will collaborate with small businesses, non-profit organizations and First Nations as they complete 17 more projects this year as a part of the Clean Coast, Clean Waters (CCCW) initiative. 
        
        A total of $8 million is being invested in tackling marine debris and plastic pollution along BC’s coastlines—around $4 million of that being allocated to Vancouver Island. 
        
        “British Columbians and communities along our spectacular coastline want and deserve to enjoy an environment free of marine debris and plastic pollution,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. 
        
        “We now know the harms that plastic waste causes to marine life and also how it finds its way into human-food sources as it breaks down. We are proud to support these innovative projects to reduce and collect plastic waste and create a cleaner, healthier shoreline for communities and wildlife to enjoy today and in the future.”`

We delivered on that pledge by reducing poverty, especially for children and seniors, and creating millions of good jobs for Canadians. Our work isn’t done,” said Freeland. “We will drive our economy toward growth that lifts everyone up. That is fairness for every generation.”
        
        As Canadians face increasing and costly climate impacts, the federal budget is an opportunity to deliver much needed investments to ramp up decarbonization but also to support a globally competitive green economy. When it comes to environmental initiatives, Budget 2024 advances some aspects of climate action and support for clean energy, but misses some key opportunities to drive optimal sustainability and economic competitiveness.`

        “So far, fewer than 35 countries have submitted their plans,” said Juan Bello, regional director and representative of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in Latin America and the Caribbean.
        
        “A central focus of this summit is to review the targets proposed by each country for implementing the global framework to see if, they will achieve the objective of halting biodiversity loss.

        Protecting biodiversity does not come cheaply. Some $700 billion is needed to kick-start action.
        
        “At present, $200 billion a year is needed,” said Juan Bello. A further $500 billion is required in economic sectors such as food and energy sector to “transform subsidies that are currently harmful to biodiversity.”
        
        A financing model for the implementation of the global biodiversity framework is key to its success. This includes the source of funding and how it will be managed.`
